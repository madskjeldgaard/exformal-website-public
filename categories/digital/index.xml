 “As one listens, one remembers that no two waves are the same; they approach from different angles at different speeds, producing variances in volume ... recedes to a quiet ending like a needle in a groove.”

&lt;p>With this release, Till Bovermann aka. LFSaw, has recorded the shoreline of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Gomera">La Gomera&lt;/a>, a small Spanish Canary Island off the coast of West Africa, in the Atlantic Ocean with an extensive setup of contact microphones, M/S microphones and geophones, turning the waves into a sensoric overflow. The result is a slow, crashing cycle of the ocean, contrasted with the sounds of a dishwasher.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Life in the Quiet Zone</title><link>https://exformal.art/releases/mads-kjeldgaard-life-in-the-quiet-zone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exformal.art/releases/mads-kjeldgaard-life-in-the-quiet-zone/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class="book-quote">

&lt;p>The text on the door presents the zone with a certain linguistic ambiguity: &lt;em>”Quiet zone”&lt;/em>. The words are neither prefixed with a definite nor indefinite article, it’s not &lt;em>the&lt;/em> quiet zone, or even &lt;em>a&lt;/em> quiet zone, just &lt;em>”Quiet zone”&lt;/em> — words floating in space, unanchored. Does this provide some cues as to the essence of this zone? It is in constant movement, on wheels, moving from station to station with its inhabitants for a moment suspended in a fuzzy existence.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Street Phonography</title><link>https://exformal.art/releases/giuseppe-pisano-street-phonography/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exformal.art/releases/giuseppe-pisano-street-phonography/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class="book-quote">

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There is an undefined zone where the elementary domain of nature - the contingencies - and the territory created by man intersect,&amp;rdquo; Gilles Clement once wrote in his book &lt;em>Traité succinct de l&amp;rsquo;art involontaire&lt;/em>. The intersection, which has always been central to the author&amp;rsquo;s discourse, is in this case not exactly a physical place, but a place of interaction regulated by chance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>As Far as the Sea Can Reach</title><link>https://exformal.art/releases/bella-comsom-as-far-as-the-sea-can-reach/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exformal.art/releases/bella-comsom-as-far-as-the-sea-can-reach/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class="book-quote">

&lt;p>When there’s no more land ~ when water overtakes both sides ~ when an island reaches its end ~ yet there’s still a thin strip of earth that divides the sea in two -

&lt;h3 id="the-following-conversation-between-johanna-borchert-anders-vestergaard-and-mads-kjeldgaard-took-place-in-johanna-borchert">&lt;em>The following conversation between Johanna Borchert, Anders Vestergaard, and Mads Kjeldgaard took place in Johanna Borchert&amp;rsquo;s apartment in the early part of 2025. A child with a cold was present. We talked about the collaboration between Borchert and Vestergaard to add perspective to this, their first release together as a duo. The conversation was short, but uplifting and added even more depth to their fantastic project. At the conclusion, we went to the hallway to put on our winter coats and leave, but before we could get back into the windy afternoon of Nørrebro, the child with the cold approached us suddenly and sang ‘O Tannenbaum’ in German. I hope you will enjoy the conversation. MK.&lt;/em>&lt;/h3>

&lt;h4 id="interviewer-what-is-the-process-behind-this-project">Interviewer: What is the process behind this project?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>JB: We were both invited to do a presentation concert at the conservatory, and I think it was there I first heard about your solo project, where I was super inspired and thought: &lt;em>How would I play to this?&lt;/em> There’s no need for anything to be added here, but I love it, and I want to be part of it. I think we met each other on the street here. We’re neighbors. And I had a rehearsal space right here on Nørrebro, and I think we just thought, why don’t we play together more often, just like a meditation or something, because your (AV) solo project was very much about that. It’s a kind of healing or a meditation of sorts—a way to enter a particular state of mind that makes you feel good. I had been thinking a lot about how music can have healing abilities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Space In Between</title><link>https://exformal.art/releases/mads-kjeldgaard-space-in-between/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exformal.art/releases/mads-kjeldgaard-space-in-between/</guid><description>&lt;p>I approach it like a child: pressing the keys as if for the first time, absorbing the esoteric output that seeps through the wooden enclosure of my pianette. Via the medium of vibrations, it ping pongs in the room and envelops my body. Then silence, or, what we call silence: the trivial sounds of the city. A child crying in a nearby playground, a moped speeding past my apartment building, two old friends wandering down the road as they talk to each other in that unmistakable tonality of complaint.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
