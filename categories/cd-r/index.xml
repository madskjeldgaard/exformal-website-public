&lt;h3 id="the-following-conversation-between-johanna-borchert-anders-vestergaard-and-mads-kjeldgaard-took-place-in-johanna-borchert">&lt;em>The following conversation between Johanna Borchert, Anders Vestergaard, and Mads Kjeldgaard took place in Johanna Borchert&amp;rsquo;s apartment in the early part of 2025. A child with a cold was present. We talked about the collaboration between Borchert and Vestergaard to add perspective to this, their first release together as a duo. The conversation was short, but uplifting and added even more depth to their fantastic project. At the conclusion, we went to the hallway to put on our winter coats and leave, but before we could get back into the windy afternoon of Nørrebro, the child with the cold approached us suddenly and sang ‘O Tannenbaum’ in German. I hope you will enjoy the conversation. MK.&lt;/em>&lt;/h3>

&lt;h4 id="interviewer-what-is-the-process-behind-this-project">Interviewer: What is the process behind this project?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>JB: We were both invited to do a presentation concert at the conservatory, and I think it was there I first heard about your solo project, where I was super inspired and thought: &lt;em>How would I play to this?&lt;/em> There’s no need for anything to be added here, but I love it, and I want to be part of it. I think we met each other on the street here. We’re neighbors. And I had a rehearsal space right here on Nørrebro, and I think we just thought, why don’t we play together more often, just like a meditation or something, because your (AV) solo project was very much about that. It’s a kind of healing or a meditation of sorts—a way to enter a particular state of mind that makes you feel good. I had been thinking a lot about how music can have healing abilities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Space In Between</title><link>https://exformal.art/releases/mads-kjeldgaard-space-in-between/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exformal.art/releases/mads-kjeldgaard-space-in-between/</guid><description>&lt;p>I approach it like a child: pressing the keys as if for the first time, absorbing the esoteric output that seeps through the wooden enclosure of my pianette. Via the medium of vibrations, it ping pongs in the room and envelops my body. Then silence, or, what we call silence: the trivial sounds of the city. A child crying in a nearby playground, a moped speeding past my apartment building, two old friends wandering down the road as they talk to each other in that unmistakable tonality of complaint.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
