<p>Exformal is a platform for sounds, music and text that challenge our notion of the real by directly engaging with it.</p>
<p>In short, Exformal is like the venerable Dr. Faustroll who shrinks to the size of a mite to examine a drop of water up close:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And having shrunk to the classic size of a mite, as a paradigm of smallness, he traveled along the length of a cabbage leaf, paying no attention to his fellow mites or to the magnified aspect of his surroundings, until he encountered the Water. This was a globe, twice his size, through whose transparency the outlines of the universe appeared to him gigantically enlarged&hellip; He gave the orb a light tap, as if knocking on a door: the deracinated eye of malleable glass &ldquo;adapted itself&rdquo; like a living eye, became presbyopic, lengthened itself along its horizontal diameter into an ovoid myopia, repulsed Faustroll by means of this elastic inertia and became spherical once more. The doctor, taking small steps, rolled the crystal globe, with some considerable difficulty, toward a neighboring globe, slipping on the rails of the cabbage-leaf&rsquo;s veins; coming together, the two spheres sucked each other in, tapering in the process, until suddenly a new globe of twice the size rocked placidly in front of Faustroll.
With the tip of his boot the doctor kicked out at this unexpected development of the elements: an explosion, formidable in its fragmentation and noise&hellip;</p>

<p>Listen, we are about to tell you what our email address is.</p>
<p>But before you sit down and doctor an email, let us be frank:  You are a good person, you deserve love and attention. That said, we are quite probably going to ignore whatever you send us. Not out of malice, nor spite, nor laziness. Not because you&rsquo;re not cool enough, beautiful enough or generally worthy of attention. No, rather, we are going to ignore your email because emails as well as most forms of digital communication are time and attention consuming, and the time we spend reading emails and composing polite responses is time we could have spent staring into the deep abyss of the iris of a loved one. And that is simply it: 9 times out of 10, the iris wins. It&rsquo;s the choice of champions. We stare at it, enjoy it, get enveloped by it, and the soul that seems to peek out at us from its depths, we greet it with a warm smile and murmur to ourselves &ldquo;fuck an email, this is it, this is what life is all about. Just this&rdquo;&hellip; <em>Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to do the same?</em></p>
<p>If not, here is our email address:

  #span-dad75a1a.cloaked-e-mail:before {
    content:attr(data-domain) "\0040" attr(data-user);
    unicode-bidi:bidi-override;
    direction:rtl;
  }
</style>
&#32;<span class="cloaked-e-mail" data-user="sdrocerlamrofxe" data-domain="moc.liamg" id="span-dad75a1a"></span>&#32;

<script id="script-dad75a1a">
  var scriptTag = document.getElementById("script-dad75a1a");
  var link = document.createElement("a");
  var address = "sdrocerlamrofxe".split('').reverse().join('') + "@" + "moc.liamg".split('').reverse().join('');
  link.href = "mailto" + ":" + address;
  link.innerText = address.split('?')[0];
  scriptTag.parentElement.insertBefore(link, scriptTag.previousElementSibling);
  scriptTag.parentElement.removeChild(scriptTag.previousElementSibling)
