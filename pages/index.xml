      <description>Exformal is a platform for sounds, music and text that challenge our notion of the real by directly engaging with it.&#xA;In short, Exformal is like the venerable Dr. Faustroll who shrinks to the size of a mite to examine a drop of water up close:&#xA;And having shrunk to the classic size of a mite, as a paradigm of smallness, he traveled along the length of a cabbage leaf, paying no attention to his fellow mites or to the magnified aspect of his surroundings, until he encountered the Water.</description>
