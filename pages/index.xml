      <description>Listen, we are about to tell you what our email address is.&#xA;But before you sit down and doctor an email, let us be frank: You are a good person, you deserve love and attention. That said, we are quite probably going to ignore whatever you send us. Not out of malice, nor spite, nor laziness. Not because you&amp;rsquo;re not cool enough, beautiful enough or generally worthy of attention. No, rather, we are going to ignore your email because emails as well as most forms of digital communication are time and attention consuming, and the time we spend reading emails and composing polite responses is time we could have spent staring into the deep abyss of the iris of a loved one.</description>
